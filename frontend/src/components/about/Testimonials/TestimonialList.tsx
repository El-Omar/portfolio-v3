      "Elomar was a true go-getter that would try everything to make sure a project was delivered on time and to spec. You could rely on him to pull through and make the correct judgement calls when needed. When the going gets tough, Elomar gets going. His skills at react and typescript made it so that ideas could be iterate on easily and allowed for short end user feedback cycles. Elomar was always willing to learn and took feedback and advice to heart. He was always constructive and eager in finding a solution that kept the needs and wants of the end user front and center. A real asset to any project.",
