Starting with simple HTML and CSS tweaks, I soon found myself building 2D games, interactive interfaces, and full-fledged applications. <br></br><br></br> Unlike design's iterative process, coding offered immediate validation—it either worked or it didn't. The joy of bringing designs to life through code, along with endless learning opportunities, keeps me hooked to this day."
